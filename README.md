# IOT Course

IOT course project using an ESP32, a LED (2 pins) and a temperature sensor (ds12b80). <br />
The goal is to create a system allowing the passage of a magnetic card to light an LED. <br />
Ultimately, this could be implemented in hotels to light up the rooms when they open.<br />
A possible evolution could be to change the magnetic sensor for an infrared sensor in order to implement the system for garages.<br />

Here is a schema of our setup:
